        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are allergic to peanuts, you can substitute it for another type of nut butter like almond butter. If you 
                are allergic to nuts, put jelly on both slices of bread instead of the nut butter.</li>
            <li>For extra flavor, try adding a sprinkle of cinnamon or a few slices of banana to the peanut butter before closing the sandwich.</li>
        </ul>
